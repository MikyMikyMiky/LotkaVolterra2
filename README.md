# LotkaVolterra2
The simulation of Lotka-Volterra competition model with unlimited population capacity

It was made during the 7th term of my education in MIREA. The main purpose of this simulation was to graph the dependencies between model parameters (birth, death and competition) and mean population number and attempt to find out if the system with given parameters had a stationary distribution.
